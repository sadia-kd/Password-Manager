# CPSC 210 Personal Project:

## ***Password Manager***

### **What will the application do?**
For my CPSC 210 project, I want to create an application that will allow a user to save multiple passwords for the 
different accounts they have to a place when it gets difficult to remember all passwords by memory. This application
will be able to store the name of the application of what the password is for along with the username/email of it. 
An application like this is useful as all your passwords will be kept in one spot. The user will have abilities to view 
all the different account information they have saved by first seeing a list of the names of the applications they
saved information for and more details when they choose to view a specific application account details like the exact
username and password.

### **Who will use it?**
This Password Managing application can be used by anyone. If an individual has too many passwords to keep track of, 
they can store them in this application. It can be useful to many ages as sometimes it can get difficult remembering 
your username and password for a new account you create for an application, or even when trying to remember a password 
of an account you made 10+ years ago. In cases like that, an application like this can come to your service.

### **Why is this project of interest to you?**
This idea of creating an application that will help someone keep track of their passwords and usernames/emails is 
interesting to me as I want to create something useful but simple at the same time. For my first ever computer science
project, I want to create something that can be useful to many individuals which is why this was one of the first few
ideas that came to my mind.
