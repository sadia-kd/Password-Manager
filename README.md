# CPSC 210 Personal Project:

## ***Password Manager***

### **What will the application do?**
For my CPSC 210 project, I want to create an application that will allow a user to save multiple passwords for the 
different accounts they have to a place when it gets difficult to remember all passwords by memory. This application
will be able to store the name of the application of what the account is for along with the username of it. 
An application like this is useful as all your passwords will be kept in one spot. The user will have abilities to view 
all the different account information they have saved.

### **Who will use it?**
This Password Managing application can be used by anyone. If an individual has too many passwords to keep track of, 
they can store them in this application. It can be useful to many ages as sometimes it can get difficult remembering 
your username and account for a new account you create for an application, or even when trying to remember a password 
of an account you made 10+ years ago. In cases like that, an application like this can come to your service.

### **Why is this project of interest to you?**
This idea of creating an application that will help someone keep track of their passwords and usernames is 
interesting to me as I want to create something useful but simple at the same time. For my first ever computer science
project, I want to create something that can be useful to many individuals which is why this was one of the first few
ideas that came to my mind.

## **Instructions for Grader**
- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by entering an application name in the first
text field, the username in the next one, and the password in the third text field. Then click 'ADD' below it to add 
this account to the password manager.

- You can generate the second required event related to removing Xs from a Y by searching an account just by its 
application name in the 'Application to remove' text field and then the specific username you saved in the 'Username to
remove' text field. Then click 'REMOVE' to remove this account from the password manager.

- You can see the total accounts present in the password manager by looking at the label at the bottom left side of\
the frame which updates when you add/remove or load accounts from file.

- You can locate my visual component by seeing it visible on the left side of the frame behind the panel for adding
and removing an account

in the drop-down menu.
